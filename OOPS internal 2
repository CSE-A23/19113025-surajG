2A. Error in compiling 

3A. If virtual keyword is not used then the child class will get two copies of data members from parent class.
    This type of inheritance is very ambiguous.

    The problem that arises when using multipath inheritance refers to a derived class having more than one
    parent class that  defines property or methods with the same name. 

4A. 
    A pure virtual function is a function that must be overridden in a derived class and need not be defined.
    A virtual function is declared to be “pure” using the curious =0 syntax.


   For example:

    class Base {
    public:
        void f1();      // not virtual
        virtual void f2();  // virtual, not pure
        virtual void f3() = 0;  // pure virtual
    };
    Base b;

5A. catch(…) is used to catch all types of exceptions arising in the program.
